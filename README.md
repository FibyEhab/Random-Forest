# Random-Forest
***Random Forest is a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method, meaning it builds multiple models and combines their outputs to produce more robust and accurate predictions. Random forests are constructed using a collection of decision trees. Let's explore its key components, how it works, and why it's effective.***
